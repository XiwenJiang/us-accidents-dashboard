# Streamlit Dashboard Outline

## 1. Project Overview (Introduction Panel)
- **Description**: Briefly explain the purpose of the dashboard, what insights it provides, and who the target users are.
- **Features Overview**: Highlight the key functionalities of the dashboard (e.g., visualizations, interactivity).
- **Date Range**: Mention the time period of the data (e.g., February 2016 to March 2023).

## 2. Sidebar (User Input and Controls)
- **Date and Time Filters**:
  - Filter data by specific time ranges: **Month**, **Year**, **Day of Week**, **Hour**.
  - Option to select specific **time of day** (morning, evening, etc.).
- **Severity Filter**:
  - Filter accidents based on **Severity** levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- **State/City Filter**:
  - Dropdown or multi-select options to filter accidents by **State** or **City**.
- **Geospatial Filters**:
  - Option to display data based on specific **regions** or **accident hotspots**.

## 3. Dashboard Main Area (Data Visualizations)

### 3.1. Total Accidents Overview
- **Number of Accidents**: Show the **total number of accidents** within the selected time range.
- **Accidents by Severity**: A bar chart showing the number of accidents for each severity level.
- **Accidents by Year**: A line or bar chart showing the trend of accidents over the years.

### 3.2. Time-Based Analysis
- **Accidents by Time of Day**: Plot a **heatmap** or **bar chart** showing the number of accidents for different hours of the day or days of the week.
- **Accidents by Day of Week**: Show a **bar chart** or **line graph** showing the frequency of accidents for each day of the week.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Optionally, a **monthly/seasonal breakdown** showing how accidents change through the year.

### 3.3. Geospatial Visualization
- **Geospatial Map (US States)**: Use **Plotly** or **Folium** to display a **choropleth map** of the US with each state colored by the **number of accidents**.
- **Accidents by City or Region**: A **scatter map** showing accident locations on the US map with markers that represent accident severity. Hover data could show details like **City**, **Severity**, and **Time**.

### 3.4. Severity Breakdown
- **Accidents by Severity Level**: Bar chart or **pie chart** showing the distribution of accidents by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- **Severity by Time of Day**: Heatmap or bar chart showing how accidents of different severities distribute across hours of the day.

### 3.5. Accident Hotspot Map
- **Density Map**: Show the **density of accidents** in various regions. This could be represented with **heatmaps** or scatter points based on the latitude/longitude of accidents.

## 4. Interactive Elements
- **Hover Information**: Display relevant accident details when users hover over a specific region or point (e.g., accident severity, city, street).
- **Click for More Info**: Allow users to click on map markers or bars to get more details about specific accidents (e.g., severity, location, time).

## 5. Data Table (Optional)
- Display a **data table** with accident details (e.g., city, severity, date, distance) for users to explore the raw data.
- Enable sorting and filtering for more detailed inspection.

## 6. Summary/Insights
- **Key Insights**: Provide a small summary or key takeaways based on the visualizations. This could include things like the **most accident-prone city**, **busiest times of day**, or **seasonal trends**.

## 7. Footer (Additional Information)
- **Data Source**: Provide a link to the dataset or source of the data.
- **Documentation/Help**: A section for any instructions or guidance on using the dashboard.
- **Credits**: Acknowledge any collaborators or tools used in building the dashboard.
