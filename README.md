# us-accidents-dashboard

## Project Goal
The primary goal of the project is to build an interactive Streamlit dashboard that provides insights and visualizations related to traffic accidents across the United States. Specifically, the dashboard should:

1. *Analyze accident trends* by severity, location (city, state), time, and other factors (such as weather, time of day, etc.).
   
2. Provide *interactive visualizations* for users to explore patterns such as:
    - Accident severity distribution across different states.
    - Time-of-day and day-of-week patterns.
    - Geospatial distribution of accidents.

3. Allow stakeholders (e.g., government agencies, researchers, businesses) to interactively explore accident data to identify hotspots, high-severity areas, or factors contributing to accidents.
   
4. Provide actionable insights for decision-makers such as policy makers, transportation authorities, or traffic safety professionals to improve road safety.
